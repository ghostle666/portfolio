<p class="overview">This project is a redesign of the very first landing page

   responsiveness, and layout using everything Iâ€™ve learned since 
   starting my journey in web development.</p>

<h2>New Version</h2>

<p>When I first created this landing page, I was just getting started with web design.
   There was no wireframe or mockup, and I had very little understanding of media queries, 
   flexbox, or how to break a page into sections.</p>
